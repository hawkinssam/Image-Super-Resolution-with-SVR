# Image-Super-Resolution-with-SVR

This project looks at image super-resolution using support vector regression. The project was completed using Google Colab, so it may be easiest to have the AT&T faces dataset in your Google Drive, and have your Drive mounted.

If implementing this method in the .py file format, it may be best to either download the data to your desktop or use Kaggle to load in the dataset.
